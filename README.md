# selforganisingmaps
This contains the files related to implementations of self organizing maps in Python.

Self Organising Maps refer to  an unsupervised machine learning algorithm which can also be used for visullazing data in higher dimnentions in lower dimensions. 

AI-Junkie provides a comprehensive description of the algorithm in below.
